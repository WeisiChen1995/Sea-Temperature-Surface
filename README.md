####ðŸŒŠ Australian Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (1995â€“2025)

Explore 30 years of sea surface temperature (SST) variability around Australia using NOAAâ€™s ERSST dataset. This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reveal dominant spatial and temporal SST patterns and visualizes trends over time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“Œ Overview

Sea surface temperature is a key indicator of ocean and climate variability, impacting weather, marine life, and coastal processes. In Australia, SST varies seasonally and year-to-year, influenced by phenomena such as El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD).

This project analyzes monthly SST data (1995â€“2025) and uncovers dominant temperature modes using PCA, providing insights into seasonal cycles and long-term changes.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Map SST across Australian waters and nearby seas.

Create animations showing monthly SST changes over 30 years.

Use PCA to identify key patterns of SST variability.

Understand ocean warming trends and regional climate dynamics.

ðŸ§° Methodology

Data Processing

Convert monthly SST data into standardized anomalies.

Arrange data: rows = months, columns = locations.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Extract dominant modes of variability:

EOF1: Spatial contributions of SST variability.

PC1: Time series of dominant SST changes.

Visualization

Animated maps of monthly SST changes.

Spatial maps (EOF1) showing key regional contributions.

Time series plots (PC1) highlighting trends and seasonal cycles.

ðŸ“Š Results
SST Animation

Dominant Mode of SST Variability

EOF1 Spatial Pattern: Cooler SSTs around southern Australia, warmer SSTs in the north.

PC1 Time Series:

Clear annual cycle: lowest in summer (Feb), highest in winter (Aug).

Explains â‰ˆ69% of total SST variability, showing seasonal cycles dominate.




Insights:

Positive PC1 â†’ warmer northern waters, cooler southern waters.

Seasonal dynamics are the main driver of SST variability around Australia.

Foundation for studying long-term trends and climate impacts.
